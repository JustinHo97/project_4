PROJECT GOAL: Brain Stroke Prediction

    One of the top 5  leading causes of death today is stroke, according to the CDC. It is important people know and understand how different health concerns might impact the probability of them having a stroke. We are able to create a model which will allow us to predict the likelihood of  a patient to have a stroke based on input parameters.

PROCESS:
1.  Find data source(s): Kaggle   
        https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zzettrkalpakbal/full-filled-brain-stroke-dataset
2.  Data (ETL) and Data Delivery
        A. Clean Data
        B. Pre-process Data
2.	Analyze Data
        A. Create Model
        B. Train the model
        C. Test the Model
        D. Optimize the Model
        E. Create a machine learning algorithm
3.  Visualizations:
        A. Create index.html
        B. Create app.py
        C. Create style.css/plot.js/static.js
4.  Presentation:
        A. Create a Readme File
        B. Create slide deck which includes charts/graphs/maps/image
